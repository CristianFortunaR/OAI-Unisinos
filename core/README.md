# OAI Core Network Detailed Setup and Deployment Guide

This repository provides configurations and scripts for setting up and deploying the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G Core Network. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps for configuration and deployment, and explain the Docker Compose file used for the core network services.

## 1. Set Up

For this setup, OAI Core Network version `1.5.0` was used.

### 1.1 Core-host Configurations

Before deploying the core network, ensure your core-host machine is configured to allow IP forwarding. This is crucial for network traffic to flow correctly through the Dockerized core network components.
```shell
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
````

  * `sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1`: Enables IP forwarding on all network interfaces. This allows the host to forward packets between different networks, which is essential for the core network's operation.
  * `sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT`: Sets the default policy for the FORWARD chain in iptables to ACCEPT. This allows packets to be forwarded by default, preventing them from being dropped by the firewall.

### 1.2 Clone `oai-cn5g-fed`

Clone the official `oai-cn5g-fed` repository and switch to the specified version. This repository contains the necessary Docker Compose files and scripts for deploying the OAI 5G Core Network.

```shell
git clone [https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed.git](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g/oai-cn5g-fed.git)
git checkout v1.5.0
```

### 1.3 Changing Core Settings

This step involves integrating custom database configurations and Docker Compose files from this repository into the cloned `oai-cn5g-fed` directory. This ensures that the core network services use the specific settings tailored for this project.

```shell
git clone [https://github.com/eduardoschulz/Interoperabilidade.git](https://github.com/eduardoschulz/Interoperabilidade.git)
cd Interoperabilidade/core-networks/OAI-CN/

rm -r ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/database
cp -r database ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/database

mv docker-compose-basic-nrf.yaml ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/
```

  * `git clone https://github.com/eduardoschulz/Interoperabilidade.git`: Clones the `Interoperabilidade` repository which contains custom configurations.
  * `rm -r ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/database`: Removes the default database directory in the `oai-cn5g-fed` setup.
  * `cp -r database ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/database`: Copies the custom database configurations (e.g., `oai_db2.sql`) from this repository to replace the default ones.
  * `mv docker-compose-basic-nrf.yaml ~/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose/`: Moves the custom Docker Compose file into the `oai-cn5g-fed`'s `docker-compose` directory.

### 1.4 gNB-host Configurations

If you are using a separate gNB (Next-Generation NodeB) host, you must configure a static route to the internal Docker network of the OAI Core Network. This enables the gNB to establish a connection with the core network components.

```shell
sudo ip route add route 192.168.70.128/26 via {ip_addr_corehost} dev {interface}

#example
sudo ip route add route 192.168.70.128/26 via 191.4.205.38 dev br01
```

  * `192.168.70.128/26`: This is the subnet used by the `public_net` Docker network, as defined in `docker-compose-basic-nrf.yaml`.
  * `{ip_addr_corehost}`: Replace with the actual IP address of your core-host machine.
  * `{interface}`: Replace with the network interface on the gNB-host that connects to the core-host network.

## 2\. Deploying the Core Network

Navigate to the `docker-compose` directory within your `oai-cn5g-fed` clone and use the `core-networks.py` script to manage the core network deployment.

  * To start the core:
    ```shell
    cd path-to/oai-cn5g-fed/docker-compose
    python3 core-networks.py --type start-basic --scenario 1
    ```
  * To stop the core:
    ```shell
    python3 core-networks.py --type stop-basic --scenario 1
    ```

## 3\. Understanding the Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose-basic-nrf.yaml`)

The `docker-compose-basic-nrf.yaml` file defines the services, networks, and configurations for the OAI 5G Core Network deployment using Docker.

  * **`version: '3.8'`**: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.

  * **`networks`**: Defines the Docker networks used by the services.

      * **`public_net`**: This is a bridge network named `oai-cn5g`.
          * `subnet: 192.168.70.128/26`: Specifies the IP address range for this network. This is critical for configuring routes on the gNB host.
          * `com.docker.network.bridge.name: "oai-cn5g"`: Assigns a specific name to the underlying bridge interface created by Docker.

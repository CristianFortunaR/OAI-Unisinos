# 📡 OAI-Unisinos: OpenAirInterface 5G/6G Lab Setup

Welcome to the OAI-Unisinos repository!  
This project documents our experimental setup and research work using **OpenAirInterface (OAI)** for **5G/6G radio networks**, deployed at **Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals:

- Deploy a functional **5G Standalone (SA)** network using **OpenAirInterface**
- Integrate with **USRP B210 SDR hardware**
- Support experiments on **RAN**, **core network**, and **5G NR**
- Create a reusable lab environment for future research and academic projects

---

## 🧑‍🔬 Current Hardware Setup:

- **USRP B210** (Software Defined Radio)
- **High-performance server** (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- Optional: **Raspberry Pi 4** for auxiliary nodes and monitoring

---

## 🏗️ Software Stack:

- **OpenAirInterface (OAI)** - RAN and Core
- **srsRAN** - For baseline testing
- **Open5GS** - (Optional for future EPC tests)
- **Docker** - For containerized deployments
- **GnuRadio / UHD Drivers** - SDR support
- **Wireshark** - Network traffic analysis

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Configuration:

> Full setup guides will be provided step by step as the lab progresses.

Planned sections:
- Environment Preparation
